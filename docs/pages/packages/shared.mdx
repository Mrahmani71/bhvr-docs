# `shared`

The `shared` package is primarily used for types that you may want to pass between server and client, but it can also be used for functions or libraries. When you create a project with `bun create bhvr@latest` this is the structure of the package.

```
shared
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

It will resemble a barrel export pattern, so the contents of `src/index.ts` are the following

```typescript src/index.ts
export * from "./types"
```

By running either `bun run build` or `bun run dev` the types will be compiled and exported from the `dist` build folder and can be used in `client` or `server`.

# Cloudflare Pages

A great way to host your bhvr client, especially since your server can be hosted with Cloudflare Workers. There are two primary ways you can host your client through Pages:
- Git Integration
- Manual Upload

::::note
Once you have chosen one of these methods you will not be able to switch between the two! Doing so will require deleting the site and starting over.

## Git Integration

::::steps

### Create a New Pages Project

Login to your Cloudflare account and then from the sidebar select `Compute (Workers)` and click the `Create` button in the top right. Select the pages tab and then select the Git repository option.

### Setup Your Project

Connect your choice of Git account and then select the repo for your bhvr project. Once select make sure you have the following items setup accordingly under the build settings:

- Framework Preset: `React (Vite)`
- Build command: `bun install && bun run build`
- Build output directory: `dist`
- Root directory (advanced): `client`
- Environment Variables: `BUN_VERSION=1.2.14` (use the latest version)

### Save and Deploy

Once you have those settings entered you can just click the "Save and Deploy" button in the bottom right, and you're done! Anytime you push a new commit it will deploy a new version of the site, including previews for branches.

## Direct Upload

::::steps

### Login to Cloudlfare

Using the `wrangler` CLI login to your Cloudflare account to authorize it

```bash [!terminal]
bunx wrangler login
```

### Setup Project

First make sure you have built the client

```bash [!terminal]
bun run build
```

Then use the `wrangler` CLI to create a new empty project in Cloudflare

```bash [!terminal]
bunx wrangler pages project create
```

### Deploy

Lastly run the following command to directly upload the `dist` build folder of your `client`

```bash [!terminal]
bunx wrangler pages deploy client/dist
```

You can automate this into a script by adding it to your root `package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
   // Other scripts
   "deploy:client": "bun run build:client && bunx wrangler deploy client/dist"
  }
}
```

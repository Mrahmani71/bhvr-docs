# GitHub Pages

Since the bhvr client is a simple static site you can deploy it just about anywhere, including GitHub Pages. Just follow these steps:

::::steps

### Enable GitHub Pages action

Go to your repo settings and click on the `Pages` tab on the left side, then select `GitHub Actions` as the `Source`

### Add the GitHub Action File

Create a new directory in the root of your project called `.github` and put another folder inside of it called `workflows`. Finally create a file inside of that folder called `deploy-pages.yaml` with the following contents. Pay special attention to the `Build Client` step as that is where you need to replace `your-repo-name` with the actual name of your repo, as well as any environment variables you want included in the build.

```yaml [.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yaml]
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  # Trigger on pushes to main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allow manual triggering from Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Set permissions for GitHub Pages deployment
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install

      - name: Build shared package
        run: bun run build:shared

      - name: Build client
        run: bun run build:client
        env:
          # Set the base URL for GitHub Pages # [!code hl]
          # Replace 'your-repo-name' with actual values # [!code hl]
          VITE_BASE_URL: /your-repo-name/  # [!code hl]

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './client/dist'

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Update the `vite.config.ts` in the `client` package

Update the `vite.config.ts` file located in the `client/src` directory to include the `base` property

```typescript [vite.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
import path from "path";

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
	base: process.env.VITE_BASE_URL || "/", // [!code hl]
	resolve: {
		alias: {
			"@client": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
			"@server": path.resolve(__dirname, "../server/src"),
			"@shared": path.resolve(__dirname, "../shared/src"),
			"@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
		},
	},
});
```

### Push to Deploy!

After setting these up you have deployments anytime you push to your main branch!

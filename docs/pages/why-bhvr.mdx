# Why bhvr?

I get it. Why another typescript framework for web apps? Aren't we just heaping fuel to the already massive dumpster fire?

While that might be true, the reality is the web is continuing to be built on JavaScript, and generally written in TypeScript. While that reality stays true, there are some concerning pieces of our ecosystem that create more walled gardens and vendor lock-in. SSR is notorious for this as it prevents web apps from being portable, where you can easily host a piece of your stack somewhere else with little to no effort. That old age was more commonly known as Jamstack (Javascript APIs and Markdown), and in that period we saw a renasiance of web apps that were lightweight, efficient, and most importantly open and portable.

The tides are turning and SSR is not always everyone's top pick these days. Developers from the Jamstack era long for the old times again, and new developers experience the frustration that comes with complicated frameworks such as Next.js. bhvr was built on a whim to fill the void Next.js leaves most developers, and it's mission now is to become a stack for the open web.
